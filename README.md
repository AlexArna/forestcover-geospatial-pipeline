# Cloud-based ETL Pipeline for Geospatial Forest Cover Data

## Overview

This project provides a scalable, cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed for handling geospatial forest cover data. It automates the end-to-end workflow for downloading, processing, and analyzing tropical tree cover raster datasets, leveraging AWS cloud resources, Python, and Bash scripting.

The pipeline is tailored for tropical forest monitoring and utilizes data from Global Forest Watch, specifically the "Tropical Tree Cover" dataset. By integrating cloud infrastructure with open-source geospatial tools, the solution enables efficient management of large raster files, parallelized processing, and reproducible analysis. This approach supports researchers, conservationists, and organizations seeking timely insights into tropical forest cover changes at scale.

Key features include automated data ingestion from remote sources, raster preprocessing and masking, tile-based statistical aggregation, and export of results to formats suitable for further analysis and visualization.
